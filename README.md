# DynamicSetProblem
Project where I had to implement a persistent dynamic set - a subclass of a binary search tree where only nodes that are affected by an add or remove operation are changed internally. 
Unchanged nodes link to previous version(s) of the tree.

Created in Netbeans for a university assignment.
